# n8n Sports Predictor

An automated sports data pipeline built with **n8n** to ingest player prop and odds data, analyze opportunities, and trigger alerts based on predefined statistical and value-based criteria.

This project demonstrates workflow automation, API-driven data ingestion, data normalization, and decision logic using a low-code orchestration platform.

---

## Overview

The goal of this project is to automate the process of:
1. Collecting sportsbook and player prop data
2. Normalizing and evaluating the data
3. Identifying potential value signals
4. Triggering alerts or downstream actions automatically

The system is modular and designed to be extended with additional data sources, models, or notification channels.
